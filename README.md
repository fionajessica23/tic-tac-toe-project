### What I have learnt

 * Naming functions and variables with meaningful names so that we know what the code is doing / about
 * Choosing the appropriate data structures that is easier to be worked on for this case
 * How to generate data-values using array and link the values to the DOM
 * Passing in the argument to the function to shorten the codes in the function
 * Declaring variables that hold boolean value to be used in checking the condition
 * Using event.target to get the information about the action that just happened and make use of it

### Future Features

 * Enable players to choose tile size for the game boards
 * Using images or other symbols to play with, instead of the traditional naughts and crosses
 * ~~Displaying players scores as they play multiple game rounds.~~ Completed
 * A banner that overlays the game when a game condition has been met
