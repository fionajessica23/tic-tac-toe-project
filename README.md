### Approach

In building a tic-tac-toe game consisted of a 3x3 tile and alternating naughts and crosses, I use arrays of 9 elements to hold the x and o values because I figure it will be easier to set the size of the boards, to access the elements values and to reset the game using loop. I also set that the "x" will always goes first when the game starts, so it's easier to create the jasvascript.
Then I created some functions, they are for making turn, to check result of winning during the game and to reset the game. The main function is the making turn function, it took me quite a while to get the code right. After making sure that the basic functions are working properly, then I added two more functions: to show the score to the players and to go to the next round.

### What I have learnt

 * Naming functions and variables with meaningful names so that we know what the code is doing / about
 * Choosing the appropriate data structures that is easier to be worked on for this case
 * How to generate data-values using array and link the values to the DOM
 * Passing in the argument to the function to shorten the codes in the function
 * Declaring variables that hold boolean value to be used in checking the condition
 * Using event.target to get the information about the action that just happened and make use of it

### Future Features

 * Enable players to choose tile size for the game boards
 * Using images or other symbols to play with, instead of the traditional naughts and crosses
 * ~~Displaying players scores as they play multiple game rounds.~~ Completed
 * A banner that overlays the game when a game condition has been met
